## Hi, I'm Juha

Welcome to my personal Github profile. I'm an Engineer of Media Technology.
Since qualifying as an engineer in 2018 I've worked as an entrepreneur and a
Software Developer. My main focus has been coding the frontend using React and
TypeScript.

In this Github profile I have a collection of proof-of-concept projects related
to my work as a Software Developer, university hackathon projects, and personal
projects in which I test out new technologies and libraries. My latest
professional Github profile is
